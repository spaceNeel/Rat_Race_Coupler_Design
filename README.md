# Rat_Race_Coupler_Design

This project involves the design of a Rat Race Coupler using Advanced Design Software (ADS). It was completed as part of the RF and Microwave course, under the guidance of Dr. Basudev Majumdar.

A Rat Race Coupler is a passive RF component commonly used for signal splitting, combining, and phase shifting in microwave circuits. It consists of a circular transmission line ring with ports placed at specific intervals to achieve the desired signal manipulation, such as a 180-degree phase shift between signals. It is widely used in mixers, power dividers, and hybrid junctions in RF systems.
